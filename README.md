# Second-CourseWork
This is my CourseWork about IoT, ML pipelines, DSL, Regular Expressions, Finite State Machines
this repository was recently created exclusively for my component. 
Most of the work was done in the Eco repository. 
I cannot provide access there since the eco-platform is not distributed in open form. 
In the directory "log" you can find screenchot of logging commits to ecoFramework repository
